Connect with the ACM Conversational User Interfaces community through our mailing list, Discord, or social media channels.

### Announcements

Sign up to receive announcements from the Conversational User Interfaces community and we will periodically send you the details of upcoming conferences, workshops, special issue journals and other relevant events. This is a moderated list so emails can only be distributed with approval of an administrator or moderator.

Please register for the mailing list on [ACM listserv](https://listserv.acm.org/SCRIPTS/WA-ACMLPX.CGI?SUBED1=CUI-ANNOUNCEMENTS "Subscribe to ACM CUI community announcements on the ACM listserv").

ACM CUI can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACM_CUI "ACM CUI on Twitter") and [hci.social (Mastodon)](https://hci.social/@cui "ACM CUI on Mastodon").

### Community discussions

The CUI community has recently joined Discord, which is designed to be an alternate forum to connecting and interacting among the community compared to the mailing list. 

Join the [ACM CUI Discord server](https://discord.gg/UeSDC2MyhH "ACM CUI on Discord").
