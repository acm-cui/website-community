Welcome to the Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community website. CUI (pronounced "coo-ee") was founded in 2018 to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines examining the design of speech and language technologies. In late 2022, CUI joined <a href="https://sigchi.org/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction" class="text-decoration-none"><span class="text-decoration-underline">SIGCHI</span>&nbsp;<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a>, the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="external" target="_blank"  class="text-decoration-none"><span class="text-decoration-underline">Association for Computing Machinery</span>&nbsp;<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction.

Today, CUI is overseen by a [steering committee]({{ '/community/sc/' | relative_url }} "Details about the CUI Steering Commitee"), who organise the [annual CUI conference]({{ '/community/conference/' | relative_url }} "Information about the annual CUI conference") and a number of [satellite workshops]({{ '/community/workshops/' | relative_url }} "Workshops organised by the ACM CUI community") at various conferences across HCI and related disciplines. The underlying purpose of CUI is to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while also developing a world class community of research and practice around CUIs.

We look forward to meeting you at a future CUI event.
