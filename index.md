# Welcome to CUI

Welcome to the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org "ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction") Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community website. CUI was founded in 2018 to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines examining the design of speech and language technologies. 

Today, CUI is overseen by an elected [steering committee]({{ '/sc/' | relative_url }} "Details about the CUI Steering Commitee"). We run the [annual CUI conference]({{ '/conferences/' | relative_url }} "Information about the annual CUI conferences") and a number of [satellite workshops]({{ '/workshops/' | relative_url }} "Workshops organised by the ACM CUI community") at various conference across HCI and related disciplines. 

Join our [online community channels]({{ '/connect/' | relative_url }}) to stay informed of upcoming CUI activities.

We look forward to meeting you at a future CUI event.
