Welcome to the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery") [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/ "ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction") Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community website. CUI was founded in 2018 to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines examining the design of speech and language technologies. 

Today, CUI is overseen by a [steering committee]({{ '/sc/' | relative_url }} "Details about the CUI Steering Commitee"). We run the [annual CUI conference]({{ '/conference/' | relative_url }} "Information about the annual CUI conferences") and a number of [satellite workshops]({{ '/workshops/' | relative_url }} "Workshops organised by the ACM CUI community") at various conference across HCI and related disciplines. The organisation seeks to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while also developing a world class community of research and practice around CUIs.

Please register for the CUI announcements mailing list on [ACM listserv](https://listserv.acm.org/SCRIPTS/WA-ACMLPX.CGI?A0=CUI-ANNOUNCEMENTS&X=DA00202F15E5DE0C2A "Subscribe to ACM CUI community announcements on the ACM listserv") for the latest updates from CUI and related conferences.

ACM CUI can also be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACM_CUI "ACM CUI on Twitter") and [hci.social (Mastodon)](https://hci.social/@cui "ACM CUI on Mastodon").

The CUI community has recently joined Discord, which is designed to be an alternate forum to connecting and interacting among the community compared to the mailing list. Join the [ACM CUI Discord server](https://discord.gg/UeSDC2MyhH "ACM CUI on Discord").

We look forward to meeting you at a future CUI event.
