# Welcome to CUI

Welcome to the **Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community** website. We run the annual CUI conference and a number of satellite workshops at various conference in HCI and related disciplines. The series was founded in 2018 to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines examining the design of speech and language technologies.

The series is overseen by a [steering committee](/sc/ "Details about the CUI Steering Commitee"). 

Details of upcoming events can be accessed from the menu on this website, or on [our Twitter account](http://twitter.com/ACM_CUI "CUI conference and workshop series Twitter account").

We look forward to meeting you at a future CUI event.
