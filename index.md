Welcome to the Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) community website. CUI (pronounced "coo-ee") was founded in 2018 to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines examining the design of speech and language technologies. In 2022, CUI joined [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/ "ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction"), the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/ "Association for Computing Machinery")  Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction.

Today, CUI is overseen by a [steering committee]({{ '/sc/' | relative_url }} "Details about the CUI Steering Commitee"), who organise the [annual CUI conference]({{ '/conference/' | relative_url }} "Information about the annual CUI conference") and a number of [satellite workshops]({{ '/workshops/' | relative_url }} "Workshops organised by the ACM CUI community") at various conference across HCI and related disciplines. The underlying purpose of CUI is to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while also developing a world class community of research and practice around CUIs.

We look forward to meeting you at a future CUI event.
