<p>
	At every annual CUI conference, Honourable Mention awards are awarded given to the top 10% of papers submitted to the conference (approximately), while Best Paper awards are given to the top 5% of papers submitted (approximately). Nominations for awards are made through the peer review process, and the final decision is made either by the General Chairs of the conference, or a specially convened subcommittee.
