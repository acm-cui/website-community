<h2>Conference proceedings</h2>

<p>
	All CUI conference proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library and can be retrieved below.
</p>

<ol class="list-unstyled">
{%- for conference in site.data.conferences -%}
	{%- if conference.dl -%}
		<li><a href="{{ conference.dl }}" title="View the proceedings of {{ conference.name }} in the ACM Digital Library">{{ conference.name }} proceedings</a></li>

<h3>Best papers and honourable mentions</h3>
<p>
	At each CUI conference, Honourable Mentions are awarded given to the top 10% of papers submitted to the conference (approximately), while Best Paper awards are given to the top 5% of papers submitted (approximately). Nominations for awards are made through the peer review process, and the final decision is made either by the General Chairs of the conference, or a specially convened subcommittee.
