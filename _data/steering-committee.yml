    bio: >
      Minha Lee is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology's Industrial Design Department with a background in philosophy, digital arts, and HCI. Lee's research on moral emotions targets mental well-being by exploring conversational agents like robots or chatbots as our moral mirrors that extend who we are. A major application area for her research is in exploring conversational agents for dementia care to foster compassionate conversations, which has been funded by Alzheimer Nederland. Lee is the general co-chair of the 2023 ACM Conversational User Interface (CUI) Conference (Eindhoven), after being a Full papers and Provocation papers co-chair (2021, 2020). The 2023 CUI conference theme highlights diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which relates to various workshops Lee has led at major HCI conferences, e.g., CHI 2022 workshop on CUI Ethics, CSCW 2022 workshop on Activism in Academia, and HRI 2021 workshop on Artificial Identity.
