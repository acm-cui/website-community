# About us

The Conversational User Interfaces conference and workshop series was founded in 2019, following the first [International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces](https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2019/ "CUI 2019"), in Dublin, Ireland.

The organisation seeks to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while also developing a world class community of research and practice around CUIs. A [Steering Commitee](/about/sc/ "The CUI Steering Committee") oversees the organisation, and is governed by a [constitution](/about/constitution/ "The CUI Constitution").
