## About the CUI community

The Conversational User Interfaces conference (ACM CUI) and workshop series was founded in 2019, following the first International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces, in Dublin, Ireland and is now part of ACM SIGCHI Specialised Conferences.  The CUI community leads many initiatives to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while aiming to develop and foster a world class community of research and practice around CUIs. The Steering Committee oversees the organisation of the conference, workshops and other CUI related events within and outside of SIGCHI and is governed by a constitution.

Further details of the community and current activities can be found on this website.
