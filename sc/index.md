# About us

The ACM conference on Conversational User Interfaces series was founded in 2019, following the first [International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces](https://cui.acm.org/2019/ "CUI 2019"), in Dublin, Ireland. A [conference]({{ "/conferences/" | relative_url }} "All ACM CUI conferences") has been held every year since 2019, as well as a [satellite workshops]({{ "/workshops/" | relative_url }} "Workshops organised by the ACM CUI community") at related conferences.

The organisation seeks to promote excellent research in human-centred issues of conversational user interfaces, while also developing a world class community of research and practice around CUIs. A [Steering Commitee]({{ '/sc/members/' | relative_url }} "The ACM CUI Steering Committee") oversees the organisation, and is governed by a [constitution]({{ '/sc/constitution/' | relative_url }} "The ACM CUI Constitution").
