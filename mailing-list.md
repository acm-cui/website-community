# Community

The **Conversational User Interfaces community** operates a community announcements mailing list as well as a Discord server.

## Mailing list

Sign up to receive announcements from the **Conversational User Interfaces community** and we will periodically send you the details of upcoming conferences, workshops, special issue journals and other relevant events. This is a moderated list so emails can only be distributed with approval of an administrator or moderator.

Please register for the mailing list on [ACM listserv](https://listserv.acm.org/SCRIPTS/WA-ACMLPX.CGI?SUBED1=CUI-ANNOUNCEMENTS "Subscribe to ACM CUI community announcements on the ACM listserv").

## Discord

The CUI community has recently joined Discord, which is designed to be an alternate forum to connecting and interacting among the community compared to the mailing list.

Join the [ACM CUI Discord server](https://discord.gg/UeSDC2MyhH "ACM CUI on Discord").
